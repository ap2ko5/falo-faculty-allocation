# Bug Fixes - Faculty Preference System

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **User Data Not Persisting on Page Refresh**
**Problem**: When the page was refreshed, the `user` state in App.jsx became `null`, even though the token was still valid. This caused:
- Faculty users unable to submit preferences (user.id was undefined)
- Navbar not showing user information correctly
- Role-based UI not working after refresh

**Solution**: 
- Added localStorage persistence for user data
- User data is now saved when logging in: `localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(userData))`
- User data is loaded on app initialization: `useState(() => { const savedUser = localStorage.getItem('user'); return savedUser ? JSON.parse(savedUser) : null; })`
- User data is cleared on logout: `localStorage.removeItem('user')`

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Added user persistence logic

### 2. **User Prop Not Passed to Navbar**
**Problem**: The Navbar component expected a `user` prop but wasn't receiving it from App.jsx.

**Solution**: 
- Added `user={user}` prop to Navbar component in App.jsx

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Pass user prop to Navbar

### 3. **Form Validation Missing**
**Problem**: The allocation submission dialog had no validation, leading to:
- Undefined values being sent to the backend
- Cryptic error messages
- No user feedback on missing fields

**Solution**: 
- Added validation in `handleSubmit`:
  - Check if user.id exists for faculty users
  - Check if facultyId is selected for admin users
  - Check if all required fields are filled
  - Show clear error messages for validation failures

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/pages/Allocations.jsx` - Added validation logic

### 4. **Dialog Opening Without User Data Check**
**Problem**: Faculty users could open the preference dialog even when user data wasn't loaded, leading to submission failures.

**Solution**: 
- Created `handleOpenDialog` function that checks user data availability before opening dialog
- Shows error message if user data is missing
- Guides user to refresh the page

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/pages/Allocations.jsx` - Added handleOpenDialog function

### 5. **Poor Error Handling**
**Problem**: Generic error messages that didn't help users understand what went wrong.

**Solution**: 
- Added detailed console logging for debugging
- Added user-friendly error messages
- Added try-catch with specific error handling
- Added validation error messages

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/pages/Allocations.jsx` - Enhanced error handling

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Login and User Persistence
1. **Login as admin**: Username: `admin@cs.com`, Password: `admin123`
2. **Check Navbar**: Should show "Administrator" badge and your name
3. **Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)**
4. **Verify**: User information should still be visible in Navbar
5. **Navigate to Allocations**: Should work without issues

### Test 2: Login as Faculty
1. **Logout** (if logged in)
2. **Login as faculty**: Use one of the faculty credentials from your database
3. **Check Navbar**: Should show "Faculty Member" badge
4. **Refresh the page**
5. **Navigate to "My Allocation Preferences"**
6. **Click "Submit Preference" button**: Should open dialog without errors

### Test 3: Faculty Preference Submission
1. **Login as faculty user**
2. **Go to Allocations page**: Title should be "My Allocation Preferences"
3. **Click "Submit Preference"**: Dialog should open
4. **Verify**: 
   - Info message: "Your preference will be submitted for admin approval."
   - No Faculty dropdown (auto-filled)
   - Course dropdown available
   - Class dropdown available
   - Academic Year pre-filled with current year
   - Semester field (1-8)
5. **Select a Course and Class**
6. **Enter Semester (e.g., 5)**
7. **Click "Submit Preference"**
8. **Verify**: 
   - Dialog closes
   - Success message appears: "Preference submitted successfully! Waiting for admin approval."
   - New row appears in table with yellow "pending" chip

### Test 4: Admin Allocation Creation
1. **Login as admin**
2. **Go to Allocations page**: Title should be "Faculty Allocations"
3. **Click "New Allocation"**: Dialog should open
4. **Verify**: 
   - No info message about approval
   - Faculty dropdown visible and populated
   - All other fields available
5. **Select Faculty, Course, Class**
6. **Enter Academic Year and Semester**
7. **Click "Create Allocation"**
8. **Verify**: 
   - Dialog closes
   - New row appears immediately with green "approved" chip

### Test 5: Admin Approval Workflow
1. **Login as admin**
2. **View allocations table**
3. **Find a "pending" allocation** (yellow chip)
4. **Verify**: 
   - Two icon buttons visible:  (Approve) and  (Reject)
   - Delete button also visible
5. **Click Approve button**
6. **Verify**: 
   - Status changes to green "approved" chip
   - Approve/Reject buttons disappear
7. **Find another pending allocation**
8. **Click Reject button**
9. **Confirm rejection**
10. **Verify**: 
    - Status changes to red "rejected" chip

### Test 6: Validation Error Handling
1. **Login as faculty**
2. **Click "Submit Preference"**
3. **Try to submit without selecting Course**: Error message should appear
4. **Try to submit without selecting Class**: Error message should appear
5. **Try to submit without Semester**: Error message should appear
6. **All errors should be clear and actionable**

### Test 7: Page Refresh During Session
1. **Login as any user**
2. **Navigate to Allocations page**
3. **Open the dialog**
4. **Refresh the page (F5)**
5. **Verify**: 
   - User still logged in
   - Page loads correctly
   - Can open dialog again without errors

## Expected Behavior Summary

### Faculty Users
- Can submit preferences (status='pending')
- Preferences require admin approval
- Cannot delete allocations
- View-only access to action buttons
- User data persists across page refreshes
- Clear validation messages

### Admin Users
- Can create allocations directly (status='approved')
- Can approve pending preferences (Approve button)
- Can reject pending preferences (Reject button)
- Can delete any allocation
- View all allocations from all faculty
- User data persists across page refreshes

## Console Logging (For Debugging)

The following console logs are added for debugging:
// When submitting allocation
console.log('Submitting allocation:', payload);
// On error
console.error('Allocation submission error:', err);
// When loading reference data
console.log('Reference data loaded:', { faculties, courses, classes });

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "User information not available"
**Cause**: User data not loaded from localStorage
**Solution**: Refresh the page (F5) - user data will be loaded on mount

### Issue: "Warning: Could not load reference data"
**Cause**: Backend API endpoints not responding or authentication failing
**Solution**: 
1. Check if backend server is running (port 5051)
2. Check if token is valid in localStorage
3. Check browser console for detailed error messages

### Issue: Dialog opens but submission fails
**Cause**: Missing required fields or validation errors
**Solution**: 
1. Check all required fields are filled
2. Check browser console for detailed error
3. Verify user.id is available (console.log user object)

### Issue: Status chips not showing correct colors
**Cause**: Status values case mismatch or undefined
**Solution**: 
- Backend should send lowercase status: 'pending', 'approved', 'rejected'
- Frontend converts to lowercase: `(status || 'active').toLowerCase()`

## Files Changed in This Fix

1. frontend/src/App.jsx - Added user data persistence to localStorage
2. frontend/src/pages/Allocations.jsx - Added handleOpenDialog with user data validation

## Next Steps

1. Test all workflows using the testing instructions above
2. Check browser console for any errors during testing
3. Verify backend logs to ensure API calls are being made correctly
4. Create test accounts if you don't have faculty credentials
5. Report any issues you encounter with specific error messages
