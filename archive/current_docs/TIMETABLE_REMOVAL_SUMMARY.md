## Backend Changes

### Files Deleted

2. `backend/src/routes/timetable.js` - All timetable API routes

### Files Modified
1. **backend/src/server.js**
   - Removed: `import timetableRoutes from './routes/timetable.js';`
   - Removed: `app.use('/api/timetable', timetableRoutes);`

2. **backend/src/schemas/validation.js**
   - Removed: `createTimetableSchema` validation schema

3. **backend/src/controllers/reportsController.js**
   - Removed: `getTimetableConflicts()` function (~60 lines)

6. **backend/verify-schema.js**

### API Endpoints Removed

- `GET /api/timetable/faculty/:facultyId` - Get timetable for specific faculty

- `POST /api/timetable/generate` - Auto-generate timetable
- `DELETE /api/timetable/:id` - Delete timetable entry
- `GET /api/reports/timetable-conflicts` - Get timetable conflicts report

## Frontend Changes

### Files Deleted
1. `frontend/src/pages/Timetable.jsx` - Complete timetable page component

### Files Modified
1. **frontend/src/App.jsx**
   - Removed: Timetable page import
   - Removed: `/timetable` route definition

2. **frontend/src/services/api.js**
   - Removed: `timetableService` with all methods (getAll, getByClass, getByFaculty)

3. **frontend/src/components/Navbar.jsx**
   - Removed: "Timetable" button from admin navigation
   - Removed: "My Timetable" button from faculty navigation

4. **frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx**
   - Removed: Timetable card from dashboard items

5. **frontend/src/components/admin/AdminDashboard.jsx**
   - Removed: `timetableService` import
   - Removed: `handleGenerateTimetable()` function
   - Removed: "Generate Timetable" action card
   - Removed: "View Timetable" action card

6. **frontend/src/components/faculty/FacultyDashboard.jsx**
   - Removed: `timetableService` import
   - Removed: `nextClass` state variable
   - Removed: Timetable data fetching in `fetchUserData()`
   - Removed: "My Timetable" action card

## Database Impact

**Note**: The `timetable` table still exists in the database schema. The SQL setup files (`supabase_setup_with_more_data.sql`) still create this table, but the application code no longer interacts with it.

### Options:
1. **Keep Table** (Current): Table exists but is unused. Can be utilized for future features.
2. **Drop Table**: If you want to remove it completely, run:
   ```sql
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS timetable CASCADE;
   ```

## Testing Recommendations

### Backend Testing
1. Start backend server - should start without errors
2. Test remaining endpoints:
   - Auth: `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/register`
   - Allocations: `/api/allocations/*`
   - Faculty: `/api/faculty/*`
   - Courses: `/api/courses/*`
   - Reports: `/api/reports/*` (except timetable-conflicts)

### Frontend Testing
1. Start frontend server - should compile without errors
2. Navigation should work without timetable links
3. Admin dashboard should show 3 cards (Auto Allocation, View Allocations, Manage Windows)
4. Faculty dashboard should show 2 cards (My Allocations, Submit Query)

## Verification Commands

```powershell
# Verify backend has no timetable imports
cd backend
grep -r "timetable" src/

# Verify frontend has no timetable imports  
cd frontend
grep -r "timetable" src/

# Start servers
cd backend
node src/server.js

cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to restore timetable functionality:
1. Check git history for deleted files
2. Restore files from previous commits
3. Re-add route registrations in server.js
4. Re-add validation schemas
5. Update frontend navigation and services
