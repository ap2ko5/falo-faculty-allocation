## 🎯 Key Features

### Auto-Allocation
1. **Smart Assignment**
   - Round-robin distribution ensures fair workload
   - Department-wise grouping for relevant assignments
   - Expertise matching prioritizes qualified faculty

2. **Status Management**
   - Auto-approved: Faculty expertise matches course requirements
   - Pending: Requires admin review (expertise mismatch)
   - Rejected: Admin can reject unsuitable assignments

3. **Conflict Prevention**
   - Checks for duplicate allocations
   - Prevents same faculty-class-course combinations
   - Validates semester and academic year

### Timetable Generation
1. **Intelligent Scheduling**
   - 40 possible time slots (5 days × 8 slots)
   - Automatic conflict detection
   - Fair distribution across week

2. **Conflict-Free Logic**
   - Faculty can't be in two places simultaneously
   - Classes can't have overlapping sessions
   - Tracks occupied slots in real-time during generation

3. **Room Management**
   - Auto-assigns rooms based on department
   - Format: D{dept_id}{room_number}
   - Sequential numbering within time slots

4. **Admin Exclusion**
   - Admin users can manage allocations but don't receive timetables
   - Timetables are only for faculty members who teach courses
   - Faculty dropdown in timetable viewer excludes admin users

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Algorithm Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(F × C × Cl) where:
  - F = Faculty count per department
  - C = Course count per department
  - Cl = Class count per department
  
### Database Operations
1. **Reads**: 4 parallel queries (faculty, courses, classes, existing allocations)
2. **Writes**: 
   - Bulk insert allocations
   - Bulk insert timetable entries
3. **Constraints**: UNIQUE constraint prevents duplicates

### Conflict Resolution
- Uses Set data structure for O(1) conflict checking
- Hash keys: `"faculty_id-day-slot"` and `"class_id-day-slot"`
- Memory efficient for large schedules
