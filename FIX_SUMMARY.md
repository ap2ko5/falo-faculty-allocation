# Connection Issues - Resolution Summary

## Problem
The application was showing "ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED" error when trying to access localhost.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Missing Dependencies**: Neither backend nor frontend had their npm packages installed
2. **Missing Environment Configuration**: No .env files existed for configuration
3. **Port Mismatch**: Frontend proxy was configured for port 5005, but backend runs on port 5051
4. **No Supabase Configuration**: Database credentials were not set up

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Dependencies Installation
- Installed all backend dependencies: `npm install` in backend directory
- Installed all frontend dependencies: `npm install` in frontend directory

### 2. Port Configuration Fix
- **File**: `frontend/vite.config.js`
- **Change**: Updated proxy target from `http://localhost:5005` to `http://localhost:5051`
- This ensures the frontend correctly proxies API requests to the backend

### 3. Environment Files Created

#### Frontend (.env)
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5051/api
```

#### Backend (.env.example)
Created a template for users to fill in their Supabase credentials:
```env
PORT=5051
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-change-this-in-production
NODE_ENV=development
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here
```

### 4. Improved Error Handling
- **File**: `backend/src/config/database.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Added validation for Supabase credentials
  - Server now starts even without valid Supabase credentials (with warnings)
  - Provides clear error messages about what needs to be configured
  - Prevents the entire server from crashing due to database connection issues

- **File**: `backend/src/server.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Database initialization failures no longer crash the server
  - Better error logging for troubleshooting

### 5. Documentation
Created `SETUP_GUIDE.md` with:
- Step-by-step setup instructions
- Common issues and solutions
- Architecture overview
- Development tips

## Verification Results

### Backend Server ✅
- Successfully starts on port 5051
- Health endpoint responds: `http://localhost:5051/health`
- Returns: `{"status":"OK","message":"FALO Backend Running"}`
- API endpoints are accessible (with appropriate errors when Supabase isn't configured)

### Frontend Server ✅
- Successfully starts on port 3000
- Accessible at: `http://localhost:3000/`
- Build process completes without errors
- Login page loads correctly
- All React components render properly

### Connection ✅
- Frontend successfully communicates with backend through the proxy
- No more "ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED" errors
- Both servers can run simultaneously without conflicts

## Current State

### What Works Now
✅ Backend server starts and runs on port 5051
✅ Frontend server starts and runs on port 3000  
✅ Frontend can connect to backend (no connection refused errors)
✅ Application UI loads correctly
✅ Health check endpoint works
✅ Graceful error handling when database isn't configured

### What Needs User Action
⚠️ Users must configure their Supabase credentials in `backend/.env` for database operations to work
⚠️ Database tables need to be created using the SQL schema
⚠️ Initial data needs to be seeded

## Next Steps for Full Functionality

1. **Configure Supabase**:
   - Create a Supabase project at https://supabase.com
   - Get credentials from project settings
   - Update `backend/.env` with actual credentials

2. **Set Up Database**:
   - Run the SQL schema in `supabase_setup.sql`
   - Create necessary tables and relationships

3. **Seed Initial Data**:
   - Add faculty members
   - Add courses
   - Add classes/sections
   - Create admin user accounts

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite 5 + Material-UI
- **Backend**: Express.js + Node.js
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens

### Port Configuration
- Frontend Dev Server: 3000
- Backend API Server: 5051
- Frontend proxies `/api/*` requests to backend

### Files Modified
1. `frontend/vite.config.js` - Fixed proxy port
2. `backend/src/config/database.js` - Added error handling
3. `backend/src/server.js` - Improved initialization
4. `SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Added comprehensive guide
5. `backend/.env.example` - Created configuration template

## Screenshots

### Before Fix
- ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED error
- Servers wouldn't start
- Missing dependencies

### After Fix
- Backend running successfully on port 5051
- Frontend running successfully on port 3000
- Login page loads correctly
- API endpoints respond appropriately

## Conclusion

The "localhost refused to connect" issue has been completely resolved. The application now starts successfully with clear instructions for users to complete the setup. The servers are properly configured and can communicate with each other. Users just need to add their Supabase credentials to unlock full database functionality.
